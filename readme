thinking about a declarative query language.

currently ... 
It sort of works. I can do a simple query. I can get an object graph back. 

We put sql snippets inline in the json. 
This works like we put inline xpath into jath?

Tests:
run using expresso


Limitations
Can't join same table twice due to lack of aliases in the generated sql.
Can't do recursive queries.

Later:

Thinking also about eventual transaction consistency .. we could 'collect'
data using promises, async callbacks.. when the transaction succeeds,
we get a callback.. if the transaction fails, we can purge later the 
half-completed data ...
