thinking about a declarative query language.

You could do joins like

var query = {
	parent: tablename 
	children: query 
}

the child query would select another group of items

Thinking also about eventual transaction consistency .. we could 'collect'
data using promises, async callbacks.. when the transaction succeeds,
we get a callback.. if the transaction fails, we can purge later the 
half-completed data ...
